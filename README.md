# CGAL_Normal
This project is for calculating point cloud normal vectors using the CGAL library for C++.The project takes as input a point cloud in txt format and the input file should contain the 3D coordinates of the point cloud.Note that the 3D coordinates should have been normalised to the coordinate system.The output file is a six-column xyz file containing the 3D coordinates and normal vector vector information of the point cloud.If you need to run the project, make sure that the CGAL library and its dependencies are installed.You can find them at https://www.cgal.org. If you need higher computational efficiency, we strongly recommend that you use release mode for your calculations.
